Display modes (click to cycle):

Current / Next (Percent) — 12,345 / 34,560 (35.7%) (default)

XP per Hour — 18,200/hr (session-based)

Kills to Level — 7.3 kills (1,250/kill) (rolling average)

Percent Only — 35.7%

How to use

In-game, move your mouse over the XP text on the HUD.

Left-click the XP text to cycle through the modes listed above.

That’s it—no separate UI or commands needed.

How the numbers work

XP/hour is calculated from the moment the plugin loads (session-based).

Kills to Level uses a rolling average of recent XP gains. If you’re doing lots of quest turn-ins or non-kill XP, early estimates may look high/low until a few combat gains occur. It will stabilize as you keep playing.
